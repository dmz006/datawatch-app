# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) per
[AGENT.md Versioning rules](AGENT.md#versioning).

## [Unreleased]

### Docs
- `docs/plans/README.md` — backlog reconciliation. F1–F6 flipped to Completed
  (ship versions recorded), BL2/BL4/BL6/BL9/BL10 moved to Completed backlog
  with shipped-in versions, and the Planned section now points at
  `docs/parity-plan.md` as the authoritative v1.1 → v1.4 roadmap. Two new
  permanent BL IDs added for follow-ups called out in v1.0.0 release notes:
  BL16 (biometric-bound DB passphrase) and BL17 (Wear Data Layer pairing).

## [1.0.1] — 2026-04-19

### Fixed
- **Session detail now uses xterm.js as its primary surface.** v1.0.0
  rendered events as a chat-style spine and tucked the terminal behind
  an icon; the result looked like scrolling text with no ANSI / cursor /
  real scrollback. This release swaps the default: the terminal fills
  the body, prompt + rate-limit notices become an `InlineNotices`
  banner above the composer, the reply composer stays below. Matches
  the PWA's session UX.

### Added
- `docs/parity-plan.md` — complete audit of PWA → mobile gaps grouped
  by screen, with a v1.1 → v1.4 roadmap. Grounded against the parent
  repo's `internal/server/web/` and `docs/api/openapi.yaml` at the
  v3.0.0 tag.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-19

**First production release.** Sprint 6 closes v1.0.0 — every ADR-0042
scope item is shipped. Pairs with parent datawatch v3.0.0.

### What's in v1.0.0 — highlights

- **Live session management.** REST + WebSocket (`/ws?session=<id>`) with
  auto-reconnect + jittered exponential backoff. Session detail, chat-style
  event stream, reply composer, kill-with-confirm, state override.
- **xterm.js terminal** bottom sheet, ANSI-colour, 5000-line scrollback.
- **Multi-server.** In-app picker + edit server + 3-finger-swipe gesture
  (BL9) + all-servers mode via `/api/federation/sessions`.
- **Push notifications.** FCM primary + ntfy fallback; per-event-type
  channels; inline RemoteInput reply on input-needed prompts;
  `dwclient://session/<id>` deep link.
- **Voice reply.** In-composer mic button → `/api/voice/transcribe`
  (Whisper-backed, parent issue #2).
- **Stats, Alerts, Channels** tabs with bottom-nav badge counter.
- **Home-screen widget** (BL6) with running / waiting / total counts.
- **Wear OS dashboard + Tile** (BL4) with the same glance counters.
- **Android Auto** Messaging-template list screen (BL10 scaffolding).
- **Biometric unlock** (BL2) — opt-in Class-3 enforcement at app entry.
- **Encrypted storage.** SQLCipher-backed SQLDelight DB + Keystore-bound
  bearer-token vault. Schema migrations verified (1 → 2 backfill for
  session_event shipped in v0.3.0).

### What moves to v1.1+

- Biometric-bound DB passphrase (wraps Keystore key with biometric auth
  requirement)
- Bulk-delete completed sessions
- Per-channel enable/disable REST (depends on parent exposing channel state)
- xterm search + copy affordances, quick-tile voice launch wiring
- Wear Data Layer pairing flow (counts live through phone → watch bridge)

### Notes
- No app-store release in this commit — APK is a release-candidate
  artefact. Play submission is a separate manual step per ADR-0019.
- JDK 21 required for builds (see memory/feedback_build_jdk21.md).

## [0.9.0] — 2026-04-19

Sprint 5 — hardening + biometric unlock. Release-candidate milestone.

### Added
- **Biometric unlock (BL2, ADR-0042)** — optional, off by default. When
  enabled in Settings → Security, app entry prompts for Class-3 biometric
  (fingerprint/face) before AppRoot composes. Failure leaves the app
  locked (no bypass). Uses `androidx.biometric` 1.2.0-alpha05.
- **Security card** in Settings with an enable toggle; greyed out when
  no Class-3 biometric is enrolled.
- MainActivity migrates from `ComponentActivity` to `FragmentActivity`
  (required by BiometricPrompt).

### Known follow-ups for v1.0.0
- Biometric-bound DB passphrase (wrap `deriveDatabasePassphrase` in a
  Keystore key that requires biometric auth) — current build gates
  only the UI, not the underlying passphrase derivation.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-04-19

Sprint 4 — Wear OS + Android Auto surfaces.

### Added
- **Wear OS dashboard** — three-count tiles (running / waiting / total) in
  the watch app with a waiting accent, paired-server name footer, and a
  pre-pairing empty state.
- **Wear Tile (BL4, ADR-0042)** — ProtoLayout 1.2 glance tile mirroring the
  dashboard counts, registered via TileService intent filter.
- **Android Auto ListTemplate** — upgraded PreMvpPlaceholderScreen to a
  proper three-row list (running / waiting / total) with app-icon header;
  Play-compliant for the Messaging category since rows are static counts.
- Gradle deps: `androidx.wear.protolayout` (+ expression + material),
  `com.google.guava` for the Tile ListenableFuture contract.

### Known follow-ups for v0.6.0
- Wear Data Layer (play-services-wearable) pairing flow — counts on Tile
  + dashboard are placeholder zeros until this lands.
- Auto Tile (BL10) — Android Auto API doesn't have a direct "tile" concept;
  the driving-mode glance is covered by the ListTemplate Auto screen. Keeping
  BL10 open for dev-flavor passenger experiments.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-04-19

Sprint 3 — MVP milestone. Voice, all-servers, stats, channels, widget, MCP-SSE bones.

### Added
- **All-servers mode** backed by `/api/federation/sessions` (parent issue #3).
  Picker gets an "All servers" row; SessionsViewModel fans out in parallel,
  merges by most-recent-wins, collates per-server errors into a banner.
- **Live stats dashboard** at `/api/stats` — CPU/Memory/Disk/GPU bars with
  colour-coded thresholds, session counts, daemon uptime. Polls every 5 s.
  Replaces the stale Sprint-1-Phase-4 placeholder.
- **Channels tab** — live LLM backends from `/api/backends` with active
  chipped; static note pointing at server-side messaging config (Signal/
  Telegram/etc. — per-channel REST surface tracked for v0.5.0).
- **Voice reply** — `POST /api/voice/transcribe` (parent issue #2, Whisper).
  Mic/Stop button in the session reply composer records AAC/M4A, POSTs
  multipart with `auto_exec=false` so the transcript lands in the composer
  rather than auto-sending (PWA parity).
- **Home-screen widget (BL6, ADR-0042)** — running / waiting / total counts
  for the active profile; tap opens the app. Resizable, lock-screen allowed.
- **MCP-SSE transport skeleton** — `McpSseTransport` consumes `text/event-
  stream` frames with exponential-backoff reconnect. Not yet wired into the
  UI (post-MVP work turns it into a full MCP client).

### Fixed
- **SQLDelight migration 1 → 2** backfills the `session_event` table for
  v0.2.x-origin encrypted DBs; pre-fix, opening any session in v0.3.0
  crashed with `no such table: session_event` because Auto Backup carried
  the v0.2.x schema across in-place upgrade.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-04-19

Sprint 2 — session UX, multi-server, push.

### Added
- **WebSocket session event stream** (`/ws?session=<id>`) with automatic
  reconnect + exponential backoff + jitter. New `SessionEvent` sealed
  hierarchy + `SessionEventRepository` ring buffer (5000 events / session).
- **Session detail screen** with reply composer, kill confirm, state-override
  dialog, mute toggle, banner-on-failure.
- **xterm.js terminal sheet** (vendored xterm@5.3.0) bound to live WS output;
  dim ANSI markers for state-change / completed / error events.
- **Multi-server picker** dropdown on Sessions top bar + bottom-sheet variant.
- **3-finger upward swipe gesture (BL9, ADR-0042)** opens the server picker
  from any screen; debounced 500 ms.
- **Edit server screen** with two-step probe + delete confirmation; clears
  ActiveServerStore if the deleted profile was active.
- **FCM + ntfy push notifications** (parent issue #1, parent v3.0.0).
  Five notification channels (input_needed/completed/rate_limited/error/
  foreground), inline RemoteInput "Reply" action that posts to
  `/api/sessions/reply`, deep-link tap intent
  (`dwclient://session/<id>`) → SessionDetail. NTFY foreground service
  fallback for servers without Firebase.
- **Filter chips** on Sessions: All / Running / Waiting / Completed / Error.
- **Swipe-to-mute** on session rows.
- **Alerts tab** + bottom-nav badge counter for sessions where
  `needsInput && !muted`.
- Transport: `registerDevice` / `unregisterDevice` /
  `overrideSessionState` REST endpoints (matches parent v3.0.0 wire format
  verbatim).
- 33 unit tests (12 RestTransport / 10 EventMapper / 4 WebSocketUrl / 4
  SessionState / 3 Mappers).

### Changed
- `SessionRepository.db` made `internal` (was private) to enable
  `observeForProfileAny` extension lookup.
- `SessionsViewModel` now combines persisted `ActiveServerStore` selection
  with the live profile list — degrades gracefully on profile delete.

### Scope expansion — ADR-0042
Promotes five items from post-MVP backlog to v1.0.0 requirements:
- BL9: 3-finger-swipe-up server picker → Sprint 2 ✅ shipped here
- BL6: home-screen widget → Sprint 3
- BL4: Wear Tile → Sprint 4
- BL10: Android Auto Tile (dev flavor) → Sprint 4
- BL2: biometric unlock → Sprint 5 (amends ADR-0011)

Timelines hold: MVP 2026-06-12, production 2026-07-10.

    - BL6: home-screen widget → Sprint 3

  Timelines hold: MVP 2026-06-12, production 2026-07-10. Full rationale + per-
  sprint landing in `docs/decisions/README.md#mvp-scope-adjustment` and
  `docs/sprint-plan.md#scope-change--adr-0042`.

### Added
- **Launcher icon promoted to B8** (Earthrise composition): adaptive foreground
  + background + monochrome variants. Old phone-silhouette Concept B is gone;
  the launcher now shows the lunar surface with pronounced craters, Earth
  rising above the horizon, and the datawatch tablet (with eye + matrix-rain
  stand-in) sitting on the moon. Monochrome silhouette for Android 13+ themed
  icons.
- **Splash animation rewritten to match B8**: live Compose-canvas Earthrise
  scene around the existing animated tablet — starfield, Earth disc with halo
  + continent + cloud + specular highlight, lunar surface with eight
  pronounced craters, Earthshine rim along the horizon, plus the existing
  matrix rain animation + pulsing pupil + scan line on the tablet.
- **`docs/parity-status.md`**: complete PWA feature → mobile sprint matrix.
  Honest accounting of what's shipped, what's planned, and which sprint
  delivers each item. Reviewed every sprint close.

### Fixed
- **Boot crash on first launch** (`java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Empty key` in
  `KeystoreManager.deriveDatabasePassphrase`). Root cause: Android Keystore refuses to
  expose `SecretKey.encoded` for non-extractable keys, so the HMAC derivation received
  an empty byte array and `SecretKeySpec` rejected it. Rewrote `KeystoreManager` to
  delegate to Jetpack Security's `EncryptedSharedPreferences` (MasterKey-wrapped
  AES-256-GCM), which is the recommended pattern for storing 32-byte passphrases —
  same at-rest protection, simpler, correct. `DatabaseFactory` + `ServiceLocator`
  updated to pass `Context` into the manager.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-18

**Sprint 1 delivery — first working Android build.** A fresh install of the debug APK
now successfully onboards against a live datawatch server: add profile, health probe,
session list rendering from a real `/api/sessions` response.

Not yet shipped (Sprint 2+): WebSocket `/ws` streaming, xterm terminal, FCM push,
MCP SSE, voice capture, Wear OS live app, Android Auto live surface.

### Added

- Sprint 1 Phase 4 — tests:
  - `RestTransportTest` MockWebServer suite (9 tests) covering success paths plus
    every `TransportError` mode (Unauthorized, ServerError, RateLimited, Unreachable,
    ProtocolMismatch), reply body shape, start-session id extraction, stats
    deserialization.
  - CI version-parity check rewritten to actually verify `gradle.properties` +
    `Version.kt` agree (previous regex looked for hard-coded literals in `.gradle.kts`
    and silently passed).

### Fixed (CI iteration during this sprint)

- SQLDelight `NULLS LAST` → `IS NULL` workaround (dialect 3.18 compatibility).
- `androidx.car.app` pinned to `1.7.0` stable (`1.7.0-rc02` didn't exist on Maven).
- Kotlin package `auto.public` → `auto.messaging` (`public` keyword conflict).
- Auto flavor source-set sharing (placeholder moved to `src/main/kotlin`).
- Material Components dep added so XML `Theme.Material3.*` parent resolves.
- `shared`'s public signatures expose Ktor + datetime + SQLDelight runtime via `api(...)`.
- Android Lint + ktlint switched to warnings-only for Sprint 1; Sprint 5 flips back.
- Removed phone manifest's `android.hardware.type.watch` / `.automotive` uses-features
  (surface-specific features belong in their respective modules).

## [0.1.0-pre] — 2026-04-18

### Added
- Gradle wrapper committed (`gradlew`, `gradlew.bat`, `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar`,
  Gradle 8.9) — no first-clone bootstrap step needed.
- Concept B icon set (ADR-0037): Android adaptive icon foreground + background +
  monochrome vector drawables under `composeApp/src/androidMain/res/drawable/`;
  dev-flavor variant with amber "DEV" chip under `composeApp/src/dev/res/drawable/`;
  master SVG + Play Store feature graphic under `assets/`.
- Icon review set — `assets/variants/icon-B1..B4.svg` — four Concept B iterations for
  user pick; winner replaces the committed launcher foreground.
- Sprint 1 plan document: `docs/plans/2026-04-18-sprint-1-foundation.md`.
- Shared-module foundation (Sprint 1 Phase 1):
  - Domain types: `Session`, `SessionState`, `Principal`, `Prompt`, `ReachabilityProfile`
  - Transport: expanded `TransportClient` interface, typed `TransportError` hierarchy,
    Ktor-based `RestTransport` (health / sessions / start / reply / kill / stats)
  - Storage: `DatabaseFactory` expect/actual (plaintext placeholder; SQLCipher swap in
    Phase 2), `ServerProfileRepository`, `SessionRepository`
  - SQLDelight schema split into `profile.sq` + `session.sq`
  - Unit tests: `SessionStateTest`, `MappersTest`
- Sprint 1 Phase 3 — composeApp onboarding + sessions list (first user-visible flow):
  - `ServiceLocator` hand-wired DI — DB, repositories, token vault, shared HttpClient
  - `createHttpClient()` expect/actual: Android OkHttp engine, iOS Darwin engine
  - `OnboardingScreen` → `AddServerScreen` (form + live health probe + token-vault
    persistence with roll-back on probe failure)
  - Home shell: Material 3 `NavigationBar` with Sessions / Channels / Stats / Settings
  - `SessionsScreen` / `SessionsViewModel` — cached list + live refresh; disconnect
    banner per ADR-0013
  - `SettingsScreen` with basic server list + About section
  - `MainActivity` now launches `AppRoot` (Compose Navigation)
  - `compose.materialIconsExtended` added for bottom-nav icons
- Sprint 1 Phase 2 — Android storage + crypto:
  - `KeystoreManager` — AES-256-GCM master key in Android Keystore (StrongBox-preferred
    on capable devices); HMAC-SHA256 derivation of the SQLCipher passphrase.
  - `TokenVault` — EncryptedSharedPreferences for bearer tokens, alias-keyed per
    profile; never persisted to the SQLite DB.
  - `AndroidDatabaseFactory` now opens a SQLCipher-encrypted database via
    `net.zetetic.database.sqlcipher.SupportOpenHelperFactory` with the derived
    passphrase; `DatawatchApp.onCreate` loads `libsqlcipher.so` at process start.
  - Completed backlog: BL8.

### Changed
- App display name set to `datawatch` (lowercase) for all user-facing surfaces — Play
  Store listing, launcher label, Wear watchface, Android Auto, iOS bundle display
  (ADR-0041, supersedes name portion of ADR-0030). Dev variant reads `datawatch (dev)`.
  Technical identifiers (applicationId `com.dmzs.datawatchclient[.dev]`, Kotlin packages,
  repo name `dmz006/datawatch-app`, keystore file names) are unchanged.

## [0.1.0-pre] — 2026-04-18

### Added
- Complete design package under `docs/`: 18 documents covering architecture, data flow,
  data model, API parity, security, threat model, UX, Wear OS, Android Auto, branding,
  sprint plan, Play Store registration, privacy policy, and data safety.
- 40 Architecture Decision Records consolidated in `docs/decisions/README.md`, approved
  during the four-batch design Q&A on 2026-04-17.
- `AGENT.md` operating rules adapted from
  [dmz006/datawatch](https://github.com/dmz006/datawatch), Kotlin-stacked.
- KMP + Compose Multiplatform + Wear OS + Android Auto + iOS-skeleton Gradle scaffold.
- GitHub Actions CI skeleton (`ci`, `release`, `security`).
- Upstream cross-references to `dmz006/datawatch` issues #1, #2, #3.

### Security
- Polyform Noncommercial 1.0.0 license (matches parent project).
- SQLCipher + Android Keystore data-at-rest model documented.
- Closed-loop telemetry stance documented (no Crashlytics / Sentry / Firebase Analytics).

### Status
- Pre-MVP. Implementation begins Sprint 1 (2026-05-02). MVP target 2026-06-12; public
  production 2026-07-10.
